Apache CloudStack is open source software designed to deploy and manage large
networks of virtual machines, as a highly available, highly scalable
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform. CloudStack is used
by a number of service providers to offer public cloud services, and by many
companies to provide an on-premises (private) cloud offering, or as part of a
hybrid cloud solution.
